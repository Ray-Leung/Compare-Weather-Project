## Description 
 <br />The projest is a web app designed to make weathers and temperuters comparasions, because users may be interested to know what major cities around the world may have the really close temperuters as theirs.
 <br />First, the app will capture the user's current location (detail into city and town) and load current weathers and temperuters information for that location from a weather API.It will also load the current weathers and temperuters information of 500 major cities worldwide.
Then it will compare the local temperature with the the temperatures of the major cities, and output the top 10 cities with closest temperatures to the local temperature and their weather information, and mark those cities in the map.
 It will allow the user to share all the outcomes to social network.
